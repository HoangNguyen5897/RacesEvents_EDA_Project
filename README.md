# Introduction #
* The data in this file is a large collection of ultra-marathon race records registered between 1798 and 2022 (a period of well over two centuries) being therefore a formidable long term sample.
* The dataset contains 7,461,226 ultra-marathon race records from 1,641,168 unique athletes.

# Objective and Approach
* I will be using different Python libraries, such as numpy, pandas to clean and manipulate data
* Then I will extract the data of the year 2019, with the race distances of 50km and 50mi to analyse and extract the insights.
* Finally, with the use of seaborn library, a number of different visualizations were created to represent different insights with the data.

# Futher Improvement
* Since this is a huge dataset, there are a high number of different aspects that can be analysed and visualised in the future.
* For example, different year rather than 2019, distances of 100mi and 100km, etc.
